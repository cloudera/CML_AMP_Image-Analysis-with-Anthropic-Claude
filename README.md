# Image Analysis with Anthropic's Claude LLM
This Accelerator for Machine Learning Projects ("AMP") allows users to perform transcription and information extraction on images using Anthropic Claude models. The app covers a variety of use cases, including text extraction, complex document question-answering, and converting unstructured content into structured formats like JSON. The advantage of using Claude 3 over traditional OCR systems is that you can specify exactly what you want to transcribe due to Claude 3's advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Use Cases Solved With Anthropic Vision Models

1. **Transcribing Typed Text:** Extracts typed or printed text from images into editable digital text, suitable for scanned documents or printouts.

2. **Transcribing Handwritten Text:** Converts handwritten notes into machine-readable text, aiding in digitizing personal notes or historical documents.

3. **Transcribing Forms:** Extracts data from structured forms while preserving their organization, useful for automating data entry.

4. **Complicated Document QA:** Answers questions based on the content of complex documents, suitable for contexts requiring deeper understanding.

5. **Unstructured Information â†’ JSON:** Converts unstructured document content into a structured JSON format, ideal for turning reports or diagrams into data.

6. **User Defined Prompts:** Provides flexibility for custom prompts to process images, catering to advanced or unique use cases.


## Choose Your Claude: A Model for Every Task

Several Claude models are tested and supported:
```
claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
claude-3-opus-20240229
claude-3-sonnet-20240229
claude-3-haiku-20240307
```

**Haiku:** Anthropic's fastest model that can execute lightweight actions, with industry-leading speed. Ideal for quick tasks where time is of the essence.

**Sonnet:** The best combination of performance and speed for efficient, high-throughput tasks. Strikes a balance between speed and power, making it suitable for most general-purpose tasks.

**Opus:** Anthropic's highest-performing model, capable of handling complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks. Best for situations where accuracy and depth are prioritized over speed.

## Using the Application

### 1. Transcribing Typed Text
The app can easily extract clean and accurate text from typed or printed images, such as scanned PDFs or printouts, allowing users to quickly digitize documents.

## Deployment

### AMP Deployment Methods
There are two ways to launch this prototype on CML:

1. **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog on a CML workspace, select the "Document Summarization with Gemini from Vertex AI" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project".

2. **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the [repo URL](https://github.com/cloudera/CML_AMP_Image-Analysis-with-Anthropic-Claude), click "Create Project", click "Configure Project".

### AMP Deployment
In both cases, you will need to specify the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` *(steps in next section on how to create this)* which enables the connection between Anthropic's API and the Application in CML.
